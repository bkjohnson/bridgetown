Happy January 2023 folks! I'm very pleased to announce the release of Bridgetown 1.2. ðŸŽ‰ [Installation](/docs) and [upgrade](/docs/installation/upgrade) instructions are available, as well as [detailed release notes](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/releases/tag/v1.2.0). (Why the codename Bonny Slope? [The answer may surprise you!](https://cedarmillnews.com/legacy/archive/706/bonny_slope_bootleggers.html) ðŸ‘€)

Some exciting stats:

* We've reached a new record with a total of **26 contributors** to the v1.2 release, many of them new to the project!
* Among the many contributions is the addition of a new "dark mode" courtesy of Neil van Beinum and Adrian Valenzuela! Finally our site doesn't have to blind you anymore when the sun goes down. ðŸ˜Ž
* There have been over 110,000 downloads of [Bridgetown on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/bridgetown) to date.
* Nearly [600 projects on GitHub](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/network/dependents) include Bridgetown as a dependency.

And ICYMI, we hosted our first-ever online conference **BridgetownConf** in November 2022, and [all the videos are available here](https://bridgetownconf.rocks) for free! Lots of great information about what's new in Bridgetown 1.2 and what's next for the ecosystem.

To recap what's included in the Bridgetown 1.2 release: ðŸ‘‡

* Weâ€™ve introduced a brand new **Ruby-based configuration format** that lets you require gems, load plugins, set configuration options, and customize your Roda applicationâ€”all at the same time with everything in one place. Say hello to `config/initializers.rb`. [Read the docs](/docs/configuration/initializers). 
* We've simplified front matter data access to save you on keystrokes. So instead of `resource.data.title` in a page template, you can just write `data.title`. We also have a new data merge feature so you could write `data.authors[data.author]` and have `data.authors` pull from site-wide data. [Read the docs](/docs/datafiles#merging-site-data-into-resource-data).
* The new content slots features provides a new way to manage how your content flows through templates and layouts. Slots are also a fantastic addition to Bridgetownâ€™s Ruby components. [Read the docs](/docs/template-engines/erb-and-beyond#slotted-content).
* Many quality-of-life improvements around i18n, helpers, SSR, and more.
